Mailing lists provide     a simple and effective communication mechanism. With potentially thousands of subscribers,     there is a common set of etiquette guidelines that you should observe. Please keep on reading.     </p>  </section>    <section>    <title>"Respect the mailing list type."</title>    <p>    There are generally two types of lists:    </p>    <ul>      <li>        <strong>The "User" lists:</strong><br/>where you can send questions and comments about        configuration, setup, usage and other "user" types of questions.      </li>      <li>        <strong>The "Developer" lists:</strong><br/>where you can send questions and        comments about the actual software source code and general      "development" types of questions.      </li>    </ul>    <p>    Some questions are appropriate for posting on both the "user" and    the "developer" lists. In this case, pick one and only one. Do not    cross post.    </p>    <p>    Asking a configuration question on the developers list is frowned    upon because developers' time is as precious as yours. By contacting    them directly instead of the user base you are abusing resources. In    fact, it is unlikely that you will get a quicker answer, if at    all.    </p>    <p>    In some cases you probably will want to use the <link href="ext:supportrequests">Support Request facility</link> instead.    </p>  </section>    <section>    <title>"Join the lists that are appropriate for your discussion."</title>    <p>    Please make sure that you are joining the list that is appropriate for the topic that you would like to discuss.   </p>  </section>    <section>    <title>"Ask smart questions."</title>    <p>    Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved    in it. You are welcome to join any of our mailing lists.  You can    choose to lurk, or actively participate; it's up to you.  The level of    community responsiveness to specific questions is generally directly    proportional to the amount of effort you spend formulating your    question. Eric Raymond has even written an essay entitled     <link href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">"<em>Asking Smart Questions</em>"</link>     precisely on this topic.  Although somewhat militant, it is definitely worth reading.    </p>  </section>          <section>      <title>"Keep your email short and to the point."</title>    <p>    If your email is more than about a page of text, chances are that it    won't get read by very many people. It is much better to try to pack a    lot of informative information (see above about asking smart questions)    into as small of an email as possible. If you are replying to a previous    email, it is a good idea to only quote the parts that you are replying    to and to remove the unnecessary bits. This makes it easier for people    to follow a thread as well as making the email archives easier to search    and read.    </p>  </section>    <section>    <title>"Do your best to ensure that you are not sending HTML or Stylelized email to the list."</title>    <p>    If you are using Outlook or Outlook Express or Eudora, chances are that    you are sending HTML email by default. There is usually a setting that    will allow you to send "Plain Text" email. If you are using Microsoft    products to send email, there are several bugs in the software that    prevent you from turning off the sending of HTML email. Please read this    <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/micromail.html">page</link> as well...    </p>  </section>      <section>    <title>"Watch where you are sending email."</title>    <p>    The majority of our mailing lists have set the Reply-To to go back to the     list. That means that when you Reply to a message, it will go to the list    and not to the original author directly. The reason is because it helps    facilitate discussion on the list for everyone to benefit from. Be careful     of this as sometimes you may intend to reply to a message directly to someone     instead of the entire list.    </p>    <p>    The appropriate contents of the Reply-To header is an age-old debate that    should not be brought up on the mailing lists.  You can examine opposing points of view    <link href="http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html">condemning</link>    our convention and     <link href="http://www.metasystema.org/essays/reply-to-useful.mhtml">condoning</link>     it.  Bringing this up for debate on a mailing list will add nothing new and is considered off-topic.    </p>  </section>    <section>    <title>"Do not cross post messages."</title>    <p>    In other words, pick a mailing list and send your messages to that mailing     list only. Do not send your messages to multiple mailing lists. The reason is     that people may be subscribed to one list and not to the other. Therefore,     some people will only see part of the conversation.    </p>  </section></section><section>  <title>Now that you have read above....</title>  <p>  Now that you have read the guidelines above, <link href="ext:mailinglists"><em>here</em></link> you find a list that gives you   a listing of the different mailing lists that you can join.   If you did not read the above information, chances are high that you will be pointed out to do so.   You might as well read it now and save yourself the embarrassment.   </p></section></body></document>
