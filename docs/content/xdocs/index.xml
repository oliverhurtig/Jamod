It can be used to         implement Modbus masters and slaves in various flavors (TCP,ASCII, RTU, UDP).		The design of this library is fully object oriented, based on abstractions         which should support easy understanding, reusability and extensibility.<br/>      </p>      <note>        You might be looking at an offline copy. The last release version of this documents        can be found at <link href="http://jamod.sourceforge.net">http://jamod.sourceforge.net</link>.         However, as the online version will reflect the latest release version, it might         be better to browse the local version that came with the release you are using.       </note>    </section>    <section>       <title>Target Audience</title>       <p>         Java developers which need to access or share data using Modbus protocols.       </p>    </section>    <note>	  This project is free and open source and this will not change in the future.      However, working on the project requires resources (beyond the ones provided      by SF). If you are willing to support the project financially, you are welcome      to make donations (via SF/PayPal).<br/>      Donated money will be used to pay Internet provider bills, provide and maintain      network facilities, enhance computing power and memory capacity. 5% will automatically      be transfered to SF.net, for providing the hosting facilities on SF.	</note>  </body></document>
